# Traffic-Light-Detection-Ai-and-CV

This is for detection of red yellow and green sign in a traffic light through yolo V3
after detection and with the help of openCV analysis of the signal is done 
and a estimate of the sign go, ready and stop is assigned.

## The video input as a frame

## only view for the red light to pass a mask is generate

The change in each frame simultaneously are observed and thuse the assigned values of red, yellow and green are made by the change in the amount of black pixel and in each frame done simultaneously hence fast assignment then that of implementation of an additional neural network can be avoided!
